## Description

This application will allow you to view all employees/roles/departments as well as add employees and update roles. This project was extremely enjoyable for me as this much more straight forward and allowable to focus on node.js in the backend as well as brush up on my mysql properties and syntax. I was also able to make sure to understand how the async and await uses benefited my code over all.
